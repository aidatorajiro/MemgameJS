# MemgameJS concept and how to play

This is a game (or installation art) to explore inside of your computer. You can explore the location where your applications' data is temporarily stored.

The operation is only mouse click. When you click, the character move toward the clicked point.

At first, you will go out to places where rectangles are arranged. Each rectangle is an application running in the computer. If you wait on the rectangle, the gauge will accumulate. Once the gauge fills up, you can get into the application.

It might be a dark, and there may be nothing no matter where you (or the character) move. In such a case, please press CMD + R or CTRL + R and try again. Even if you enter the same application, you will be transported into different places, something may come out the second time.

If you find any change, it means that your computer is now currently recording something. There will be a sense of thrill, excitement like when you peeked through the microscope and found something moving!

Every data stored there have some meaning for the applications. However, it is difficult for us to know the meanings. (Of course, if you are a trained expert, there will be things for you to understand ...)

Also, when I am exploring, I sometimes feel like being in ruins. Internal data of the computer that I can not understand. Occasionally some structures are seen, but I do not know what they means. However, I will walk through tiles, thinking of these structures, like exploring ruins... I am enjoying like that!

Of course, there are many other ways to enjoy, so let's seek for your own "How to play"!
